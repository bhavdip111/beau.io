Using Composer and Packagist makes using 3rd-party code easier but relying on 3rd-party code can have drawbacks. Projects are abandoned. Maintainers become unresponsive. Fortunately, Composer provides tools to help make these situations a little easier to manage. Learn how to leverage Composer features like "replace" and tools like Satis to manage forks of 3rd-party packages. See pros and cons of various methods so that you can feel more confident in how you decide to move forward with decomposing other people's packages.
