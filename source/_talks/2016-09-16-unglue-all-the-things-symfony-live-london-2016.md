{% block description %}

Bundles. Packages. Modules. Plugins. So much code is locked up in framework-specific packages. With so many people talking about wanting to write framework agnostic packages, it can be easy to get stuck thinking that this is, and should always be, the end goal. Learn about one developer's experience trying to write truly framework agnostic code. See what worked, what didn't, and walk away having a better idea how you, too, can attempt to unglue all the things!
