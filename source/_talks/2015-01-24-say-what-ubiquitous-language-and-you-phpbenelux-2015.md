        title: "Say What? Ubiquitous Language and You! &middot; Beau Simensen &middot; dflydev.com"
        description: "When you discuss a project with other people involved with a project in any capacity are you ever absolutely certain that they understand exactly what you’ve said? If you haven’t paid super close attention to naming chances are you can’t be certain! What if you could all speak the same language? One of the core Domain-Driven Design (DDD) tools is the Ubiquitous Language. By paying close attention to how domain experts (people intimately familiar with how a specific part of a business actually runs) you will start learning critical information that you can use to help ensure that your code more accurately models the business processes it represents. While this is an important part of practicing DDD the idea behind the Ubiquitous Language can be applied to almost any project to help keep everyone involved on the same page!"
