Thanks largely to Composer and its tight integration with GitHub, it has never been easier for people to share and contribute to the PHP ecosystem. These days, it more or less required that contributors have a working knowledge of Git and GitHub to be effective. Thankfully, learning how to use Git and GitHub doesn't have to be scary. Whether you're new to Git, still using Subversion, or don't have any experience with version control systems, this workshop will get you started using Git and GitHub so that you can start contributing back to your favorite PHP projects!
