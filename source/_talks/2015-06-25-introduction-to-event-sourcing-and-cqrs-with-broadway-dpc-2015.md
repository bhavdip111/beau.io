Have you looked at Broadway from the Qandidate.com team but are not quite sure where to start? Have you wondered how you might integrate it into your new or legacy application? Perhaps you are new to Event Sourcing and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and not sure if Broadway is the right choice for you?

Get a tour of Broadway's components to see how they work. See practical examples of Broadway in action. Learn the limitations of Broadway and the benefits you'll get from using one of PHP's first open-source and production-ready Event Sourcing and CQRS packages. Find out how you can put Broadway to work for you today!

*This tutorial assumes some basic knowledge of Event Sourcing and CQRS. There will be quick overviews of the core concepts but will mostly focus on using Broadway. For more information on the core concepts, consider attending the morning tutorial, "Introduction to Event Sourcing and CQRS." The two tutorials are intended to compliment each other and attending both is encouraged.*
