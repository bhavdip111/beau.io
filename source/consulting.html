                I created <a href="http://dflydev.com/">dflydev</a>
                in 2009 so that I could help people solve interesting problems.
                In 2015 I co-founded <a href="http://monii.com">Monii</a> and am now
                focussing all of my effort architecting, designing, and overseeing
                the development of Monii's platform. If you would like to contact
                me about consulting anyway, you can do so
                <a href="http://dflydev.com/contact/">here</a>.
