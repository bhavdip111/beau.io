{% block description %}

Composer is a wonderful way to manage a project. But what happens when you need your application to be extensible at runtime? Enter Embedded Composer. Embedding Composer will ensure that the dependencies already included by your application are taken into account when adding additional dependencies at runtime. While this can be very useful for any application that may be installed globally it is critical for any application that may be distributed as a phar.
