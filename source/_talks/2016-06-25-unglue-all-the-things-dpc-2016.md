{% block description %}

Bundles. Packages. Modules. Plugins. So much code is locked up in framework-specific packages. Integration packages are not bad, but losing the ability to reuse code that has nothing to do with a specific framework's implementation is! Don't let reusable code get locked into framework-specific glue packages! Come see practical strategies for writing framework agnostic code and walk away having a better idea how you, too, can unglue all the things!
