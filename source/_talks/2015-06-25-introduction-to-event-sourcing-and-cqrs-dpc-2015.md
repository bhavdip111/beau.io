Have you heard about Event Sourcing and wondered what it is all about? Are you curious how you could begin moving an existing applications to be Event Sourced? Have you wondered why people seem to talk about CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) whenever discussing Event Sourcing?

Take a step back and learn what Event Sourcing is. Learn the basics of CQRS and how Event Sourcing can be used to enable CQRS. See how both Event Sourcing and CQRS can be used together with Domain-Driven Design. Finally, see how you can start moving an existing model to use events to start projecting a Read Model and laying the groundwork to becoming a fully Event Sourced model with CQRS.

*This tutorial assumes no knowledge of Event Sourcing or CQRS. For practical information on implementing Event Sourcing and CQRS, consider attending the afternoon tutorial, "Introduction to Event Sourcing and CQRS with Broadway." The two tutorials are intended to compliment each other and attending both is encouraged.*
